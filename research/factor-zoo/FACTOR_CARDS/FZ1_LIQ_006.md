# FZ1_LIQ_006 — Negative return per turnover 20

- Family: `LIQUIDITY`
- Concept: `TURNOVER_SCALED_PRICE_IMPACT`
- Parameterization group: `FZ1_LIQ_006` / `SINGLE`
- Abstraction: `TRANSFORMED`
- Definition status: `DRAFT_DESIGN`
- Evaluation stage: `P0_8B`
- Lifecycle: `DISCOVERED`

## Formula

`-mean(abs(r1)/(turnover+1e-12) over 20)`

Lookback/input horizon: 20 sessions.

## Inputs and timing

Raw fields:

- `close`
- `turnover`
- `adj_factor`

Derived inputs:

- `adjusted OHLC/returns and rolling statistics exactly as referenced`

Availability: `AFTER_T_CLOSE; EARLIEST_T_PLUS_1_OPEN`.

## Hypothesis

Direction: `HIGHER_EXPECTED_BETTER`.

Lower return movement per turnover may proxy deeper liquidity when amount scale is heterogeneous.

Common-use note: Common daily-bar factor construct; common usage is not empirical validation here.

## Implementation profile

- Expected turnover: `HIGH`
- Execution sensitivity: Daily-batch delay, next-open gap, and synthetic cost assumptions.
- Data readiness: `READY_WITH_WARNINGS`

Likely related/redundant factors:

- `PG_LIQ_AMIHUD`
- `FZ1_TOV_001`

PIT/lookahead risks:

- `PARTIAL_ACTION_FACTOR_COVERAGE_ACTION_AWARE_SUBSET_ONLY`
- `CURRENT_CAPTURE_NON_PIT_UNIVERSE`
- `T_PLUS_1_EXECUTION_ONLY`
- `RAW_VOLUME_SPLIT_AND_PROVIDER_SEMANTICS`
- `PARTIAL_HISTORICAL_TRADABILITY_STATE`
- `CURRENT_CAPTURE_NON_PIT_UNIVERSE`

Provenance:

- `P0_8_CANONICAL_DAILY_BAR_TAXONOMY`
