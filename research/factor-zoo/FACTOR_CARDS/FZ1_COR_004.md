# FZ1_COR_004 — Return versus market-breadth-change correlation 60

- Family: `ROLLING_CORRELATION`
- Concept: `BREADTH_SENSITIVITY`
- Parameterization group: `FZ1_COR_004` / `SINGLE`
- Abstraction: `TRANSFORMED`
- Definition status: `DRAFT_DESIGN`
- Evaluation stage: `P0_8B`
- Lifecycle: `DISCOVERED`

## Formula

`corr(r1, delta(equal_weight_positive_return_share) over 60)`

Lookback/input horizon: 61 sessions.

## Inputs and timing

Raw fields:

- `close`
- `adj_factor`

Derived inputs:

- `adjusted OHLC/returns and rolling statistics exactly as referenced`

Availability: `AFTER_T_CLOSE_DERIVED_MARKET; EARLIEST_T_PLUS_1_OPEN`.

## Hypothesis

Direction: `HIGHER_EXPECTED_BETTER_DIAGNOSTIC`.

Sensitivity to changes in market breadth may distinguish broad-beta exposure from idiosyncratic behavior.

Common-use note: Common daily-bar factor construct; common usage is not empirical validation here.

## Implementation profile

- Expected turnover: `MEDIUM`
- Execution sensitivity: Daily-batch delay, next-open gap, and synthetic cost assumptions.
- Data readiness: `LIMITED`

Likely related/redundant factors:

- `PG_COR_MARKET`
- `FZ1_MKT_001`

PIT/lookahead risks:

- `PARTIAL_ACTION_FACTOR_COVERAGE_ACTION_AWARE_SUBSET_ONLY`
- `CURRENT_CAPTURE_NON_PIT_UNIVERSE`
- `T_PLUS_1_EXECUTION_ONLY`
- `DERIVED_EQUAL_WEIGHT_MARKET_INHERITS_UNIVERSE_BIAS`

Provenance:

- `P0_8_CANONICAL_DAILY_BAR_TAXONOMY`
