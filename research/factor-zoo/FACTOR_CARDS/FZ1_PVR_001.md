# FZ1_PVR_001 — Return-volume correlation 20

- Family: `PRICE_VOLUME_RELATION`
- Concept: `PRICE_VOLUME_CORRELATION`
- Parameterization group: `PG_PVR_CORRELATION` / `SHORT`
- Abstraction: `TRANSFORMED`
- Definition status: `DRAFT_DESIGN`
- Evaluation stage: `P0_8B`
- Lifecycle: `DISCOVERED`

## Formula

`corr(r1,delta(log1p(volume))) over 20`

Lookback/input horizon: 21 sessions.

## Inputs and timing

Raw fields:

- `close`
- `volume`
- `adj_factor`

Derived inputs:

- `adjusted OHLC/returns and rolling statistics exactly as referenced`

Availability: `AFTER_T_CLOSE; EARLIEST_T_PLUS_1_OPEN`.

## Hypothesis

Direction: `HIGHER_EXPECTED_BETTER_DIAGNOSTIC`.

Positive co-movement between returns and activity may indicate confirmation; negative co-movement may indicate distribution.

Common-use note: Common daily-bar factor construct; common usage is not empirical validation here.

## Implementation profile

- Expected turnover: `MEDIUM`
- Execution sensitivity: Daily-batch delay, next-open gap, and synthetic cost assumptions.
- Data readiness: `LIMITED`

Likely related/redundant factors:

- `FZ1_PVR_002`
- `FZ1_VOLM_002`

PIT/lookahead risks:

- `PARTIAL_ACTION_FACTOR_COVERAGE_ACTION_AWARE_SUBSET_ONLY`
- `CURRENT_CAPTURE_NON_PIT_UNIVERSE`
- `T_PLUS_1_EXECUTION_ONLY`
- `RAW_VOLUME_SPLIT_AND_PROVIDER_SEMANTICS`
- `PARTIAL_HISTORICAL_TRADABILITY_STATE`
- `CURRENT_CAPTURE_NON_PIT_UNIVERSE`

Provenance:

- `P0_8_CANONICAL_DAILY_BAR_TAXONOMY`
