# FZ1_MOM_002 — Adjusted total return 60

- Family: `MOMENTUM`
- Concept: `TOTAL_RETURN_MOMENTUM`
- Parameterization group: `PG_MOM_TOTAL_RETURN` / `MEDIUM`
- Abstraction: `ATOMIC`
- Definition status: `DRAFT_DESIGN`
- Evaluation stage: `P0_8B`
- Lifecycle: `DISCOVERED`

## Formula

`adj_close[t] / adj_close[t-60] - 1`

Lookback/input horizon: 60 sessions.

## Inputs and timing

Raw fields:

- `close`
- `adj_factor`

Derived inputs:

- `adjusted OHLC/returns and rolling statistics exactly as referenced`

Availability: `AFTER_T_CLOSE; EARLIEST_T_PLUS_1_OPEN`.

## Hypothesis

Direction: `HIGHER_EXPECTED_BETTER`.

Persistent underreaction may make past relative winners continue to outperform.

Common-use note: Common daily-bar factor construct; common usage is not empirical validation here.

## Implementation profile

- Expected turnover: `MEDIUM`
- Execution sensitivity: Daily-batch delay, next-open gap, and synthetic cost assumptions.
- Data readiness: `LIMITED`

Likely related/redundant factors:

- `PG_REV_TOTAL_RETURN`
- `PG_TREND_PRICE_SMA`

PIT/lookahead risks:

- `PARTIAL_ACTION_FACTOR_COVERAGE_ACTION_AWARE_SUBSET_ONLY`
- `CURRENT_CAPTURE_NON_PIT_UNIVERSE`
- `T_PLUS_1_EXECUTION_ONLY`

Provenance:

- `STANDARD_MOMENTUM`
- `P0_7C_MOMENTUM_LINEAGE`

- `P0_8A_FULL_WINDOW_MISSINGNESS_AND_TIMING_CHECK`
