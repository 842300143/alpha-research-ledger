# FZ1_RNG_005 — Negative Bollinger bandwidth 20

- Family: `RANGE_ATR_COMPRESSION`
- Concept: `PRICE_BAND_COMPRESSION`
- Parameterization group: `FZ1_RNG_005` / `SINGLE`
- Abstraction: `ATOMIC`
- Definition status: `DRAFT_DESIGN`
- Evaluation stage: `P0_8B`
- Lifecycle: `DISCOVERED`

## Formula

`-4*std(adj_close,20)/mean(adj_close,20)`

Lookback/input horizon: 20 sessions.

## Inputs and timing

Raw fields:

- `close`
- `adj_factor`

Derived inputs:

- `adjusted OHLC/returns and rolling statistics exactly as referenced`

Availability: `AFTER_T_CLOSE; EARLIEST_T_PLUS_1_OPEN`.

## Hypothesis

Direction: `HIGHER_EXPECTED_BETTER`.

Narrow normalized price bands indicate compression distinct from raw return volatility scale.

Common-use note: Common daily-bar factor construct; common usage is not empirical validation here.

## Implementation profile

- Expected turnover: `HIGH`
- Execution sensitivity: Daily-batch delay, next-open gap, and synthetic cost assumptions.
- Data readiness: `LIMITED`

Likely related/redundant factors:

- `FZ1_RNG_004`
- `FZ1_VOL_001`

PIT/lookahead risks:

- `PARTIAL_ACTION_FACTOR_COVERAGE_ACTION_AWARE_SUBSET_ONLY`
- `CURRENT_CAPTURE_NON_PIT_UNIVERSE`
- `T_PLUS_1_EXECUTION_ONLY`

Provenance:

- `P0_8_CANONICAL_DAILY_BAR_TAXONOMY`
